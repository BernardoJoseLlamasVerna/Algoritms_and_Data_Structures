Dynamic Programming:
--------------------
- A method for solving complex problem by breaking it into a collection of simpler subproblems,
  solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.
- It only works on problems with:
    - Optimal Substructure.
    - Overlapping Subproblems.

1.-Overlapping Subproblems:
---------------------------
- A problem is said to have overlapping subproblems
  if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times
  (i.e. Fibonacci Sequence).

2.-Optimal Substructure:
------------------------
- A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal
  solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems
  (i.e. Fibonacci Sequence ---> Fibonacci of 5 depends on Fibonacci of 4, 3, 2.. ).

3.-Memoization:
---------------
- Storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached
  result when the same inputs occur again.

4.-Tabulation:
--------------
- Storing the result of a previous result in a "table" (usually an array)
- Usually done using iteration.
- Better space complexity can be achieved using tabulation.
