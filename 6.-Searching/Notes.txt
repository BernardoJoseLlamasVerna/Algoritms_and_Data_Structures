Linear Search:
--------------
Given an array, the simplest way to search for a value is to look at every element in the array and check
if it's the value we want.

JS implements indexOf, includes, find, findIndex.

Linear Search Big O implementation:
-----------------------------------
- best scenario: O(1), search something that exists on the array ---> O(1) operations
- worst scenario: O(n), search something that doesn't exist on the array ---> O(n) operations
- average: O(n) ---> something almost at the end of the array.

Binary Search:
--------------
- binary search is a much faster form of search.
- rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate half
  of the remaining elements at a time.
- IMPORTANT: binary search only works on sorted arrays!
