* this pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values.
* this can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(NÂ²) operations with arrays/strings.

Example: write a function called same(), which accepts 2 arrays.
The function should return TRUE if every value in the array has its corresponding value squared in the second array.
The frequency of values must be the same.

Note: 2 for-loops better than 2 nested for-loops.
