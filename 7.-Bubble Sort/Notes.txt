What is sorting?
----------------
- Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection
  (e.g. an array) so that the items are in some kind of order.
- Sorting is an incredibly common task, so it's good to know how it works.
- There are many different ways to sort things and different techniques
  have their own advantages and disadvantages.

Bubble Sort:
------------
- A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top!
- As we're forlooping an array we compare each element with its following.
-- if our element is larger than what we're comparing it to
    ---> we swap: jump to the next element and compare. If is larger again, swap again.
-- if our element is smaller, compare next element to its next.

===> a sorting algorith where the largest values bubble up to the top.

[5, 3, 4, 1, 2] --> [3, 5, 4, 1, 2] --> [3, 4, 5, 1, 2] ---> [3, 4, 1, 5, 2] --> [3, 4, 1, 2, 5]

- Many sorting algorithms involve some type of swapping functionality
  (e.g. swapping to numbers to put them in order)

BubbleSort Pseudocode:
----------------------
- Start looping from with a variable called i the end of the array towards the beginning.
- Start an inner loop with a variable called j from the beginning until i-1.
- If arr[j] is greater than arr[j + 1], swap those two values!.
- Return the sorted array.

Time Complexity:
----------------
- O(nÂ²) ---> using noSwaps variable on optimized version, is almost linear O(n)
