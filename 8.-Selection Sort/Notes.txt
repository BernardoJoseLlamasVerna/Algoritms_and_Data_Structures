Selection Sort:
---------------
- Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position,
  it places small values into sorted position.

  * loop through an array comparing values looking for the smallest; once finished, set the smallest at
  the beginning. Next step is to loop the same array except the first element --> new subarray created.

Selection Sort Pseudocode:
--------------------------
- Store the first element as the smallest value you've seen so far.
- Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number.
- If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new "minimum"
  and continue until the end of the array.
- If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new "minimum"
  and continue until the end of the array.
- If the "minimum" is not the value (index) you initially began with, swap the two values.
- Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.

Time Complexity:
----------------
- Is not very time efficient. ---> but is better tha bubble sort (too much swaping).
