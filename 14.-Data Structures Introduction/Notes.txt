Data Structures:
----------------
- Data Structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions
  or operations that can be applied to the data.

Why so many?
------------
- Different Data Structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized,
  while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

NOTE: There is no one best data structure.
- Working with map/location data? ===> Use a graph.
- Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end? ===> Use a linked list.
- Web scraping nested HTML? ===> Use a tree.
- Need to write a scheduler? ===> Use a binary heap.

NOTE: We're going to implement data structures as classes.
i.e.:
class DataStructure() {
    constructor() {
        // what default properties should it have?
    }
    someInstanceMethod() {
        // what should each object created from this class be able to do?
    }
}

- Classes are blueprints that when created make objects known as instances.
- Classes are created with the "new" keyword.
- The constructor function is a special function that gets run when the class is instantiated.
- Instance methods can be added to classes similar to methods in objects.
- Class methods can be added using the static keyword.
